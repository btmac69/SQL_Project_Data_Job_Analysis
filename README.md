# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here:  [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data analyst job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The data for this analysis is from [Luke Barousse’s SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are in most demand for Data Analysts?
4. What skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location IN ('Anywhere','Cincinnati, OH')
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 100
```
### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top10_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top10_jobs.job_id,
    company_name,
    job_title,
    skills,
    salary_year_avg
FROM
    top10_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top10_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),2) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC,
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Each query not only served to answer a specific question but also to improve my understanding of SQL and database analysis. Through this project, I learned to leverage SQL's powerful data manipulation capabilities to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

# What I Learned
Throughout this project, I honed several key SQL techniques and skills:
- **Complex Query Construction**: Learning to build advanced SQL queries that combine multiple tables and employ functions like WITH clauses for temporary tables.
- **Data Aggregation**: Utilizing GROUP BY and aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() to summarize data effectively.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Developing the ability to translate real-world questions into actionable SQL queries that got insightful answers.

# Conclusion
